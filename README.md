Computer Aided Engineering (MEC524) 
Assignment: 3D Modelling  Downstream ApplicationsYou   are   required   to   model   an   assembly   using   Solid   Edge   software. The   suitability   of the   assembly   selected   must be ratified by the tutor before you commence modelling. You should aim to demonstrate   good   modelling   practice   as you   utilise   a   range   of   modelling techniques.   In   addition, you   should   make   evident   the   value   of   3D   CAD   modelling   by   using   a   broad   range   of the functionality   of the   Solid   Edge   software,   including   downstream applications of the   model as   identified   below.   Please   note that   model complxity   has   little to   no   bearing on   marks if you are not confident with CAD/CAE consider choosing a simple product to model.1 Modelling  Downstream Applications                                                                                          70

Submission Your   report should   be submitted asan A4 document   (11   pt.   using an   appropriate   Serif font   (e.g., Times   New   Roman),   20   pages   not   inlcuding   title/contents/references)   to the Turnitin   submission   point   on   Blackboard.   It   should   be   properly   structured   with   a   title   page,   contents   page,   introduction   and   pages   numbered   and   sections A - Z   clearly   identified   as   outlined   above.   Please   include   high   quality   images throughout   and   make   the   report engaging.An   archive   (.zip)   containing   a   copy   of   relevant files   should   be   uploaded to   BlackBoard   Learn   as   per supplied   instructions.    The    archive,    at      root       level,    should    contain      one      folder      with      the      name       B00123456,    where   B00123456    represents YOUR student    ID.    Within   this    main   folder   you   should    use    an    appropriate   folder   structure so that   all files are   in   a   logical   place and   easily   navigable   for   review   by   the   tutor.   Clear   referencing   must    be    provided   within   the    report   to    files,   their    location,    how   they    should    be    opened    and    used.    It    is   imperative that you   make   sure that   assembly files   etc.   open   correctly   with   all   necessary   part   files   available   in the correct folders   in your file   structure.

Guidance 
The following guidelines are offered to   help you with   your   assignment.
1.         The report should NOT be written in the first person (“I” should not appear). For example, you should   not   say, “I   created the feature   by   using the   Extrude   command.”   It   should   be   written   in   the   passive;      e.g. “The   Loft function   enables the   user to   …”   .
2.         The   key   to   writing   a   concise   and   clear   report   is   to   use   plenty   of   carefully   selected   illustrations   of   sketches,       intermediate       stages,       etc.       Illustrate       your         description      throughout         with         appropriate   screenshots   and    keep    your    descriptions    brief.    When    describing   your    modelling    approach,    bullet   points are   particularly appropriate. Screenshots can   be   captured   easily   using the   Snipping Tool.
3.          In Sections A –   Z,a   description   of   how   you   have   achieved   the   result   is NOT required.   However,   you   should    concisely    explain    what      you      have      done      and      most      importantly      show      the      value      of      these   downstream    applications,    as    well      as      how    they      would      be      used      in      an      industrial      product      design   environment.    Examples    from    the    technical    press,    properly    referenced,      should      be      included.    You   should      demonstrate      a    thoughtful,      critical    evaluation       of    the      downstream       applications.      A       non-   exhaustive   list of the sort of things you   should   include   can   be found   in the Section Breakdown.
4.         The    file    structure    in      your      ZIP      file      should      correspond      to      the      sections      in       Part       1      Modelling    and   Downstream   Applications   and   conform   to   the   arrangement   shown   below,   using   the   folder   names   specified.   Please ensure Design Manager is   used to   move/rename files and folders to avoid   breaking   associative   links.   If   you   feel   you   need   to   place   some   files   differently,   you   must   be   very   careful   to   clearly   state   where   they   are.   The   B00123456   folder   (where   B00123456   represents YOUR student   number) should   be the top-level folder   in the ZIP file.
